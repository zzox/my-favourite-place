This was originally called "choose" and started (but not finished) for the [Pursuing Pixelsâ€™ James Jam Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pursuing-pixels-james-jam-game-gam). I have made a few platformers since starting gamedev and have enjoyed help from those gracious enough to open-source their games.

This project includes some platformer features that I like:
- coyote time
- jump buffering
- dash corner correction (nudging)
- variable hitstop

This project also contains features that HaxeFlixel makes easy:
- toggleable crt effect shader
- saving
- newgrounds integration
- ldtk tilemap integration

## To run
Instructions on installing HaxeFlixel are [here](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/).

This project also uses [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) for easy level creation.
